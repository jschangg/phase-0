# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
Time boxing/Pomodoro technique was the time management technique that really stuck out to me. Whenever i have a particular assignment with a deadline i always alot certain portions of my day to complete the task. I will now take a more precise look at the task at hand by breaking it down to smaller assignments and thereby allotting smaller increments of time to finish them.

I also enjoyed learning about meditation and how it can help increase productivity by freeing up your mind. It will allow you to become less anxious, more creative, and ultimately more focused.

Time-boxing is when you designate a specific amount of time to complete a task. And when the time is up regardless of whether or not the task is complete you stop and take time to evaluate what yu have done/the time you gave yourself to complete that task. I can implement it in phase 0 by allotting x amount of time to specific challenges and tasks assigned to me. C

Currently i manage my time by just reviewing what i need to then, then picking out certain days throughout the week when i have the time to work on them. Then i try to finish the work in that time. It really hasnt worked out to well for me for the first week, since the work took a lot longer than i thought it would, along with having a lot less time to work on it due to being away for the holidays.

I will definitely be implementing the time box technique. I think its an highly effective technique and it will require me to stay focused for certain chunks of time. This period by period focus will help me finish my tasks more efficiently and hopefully more precisely.
## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1. a shell is a user interface so that one may use to access and manipulate the operating system and i believe bash (bourne again shell) is a shell for the unix system (mac)

2. it took me a little longer to understand the pushd and popd.

3. yes i was able to use all the commands by following and finishing the "Command Line Crash Course." However it did take me some time to understand some of the commands like pushd & popd.

4. In my opinion the most important commands are pwd - print working directory, ls - list directory, cd - change directory, grep - find things in file. I think these are the commands i will be using the most/make a coders life easer. However, ill probably use all of the commands i just learned a lot.

5.

pwd - print working directory

ls - list directory

mv - move a file or directory

cd - change directory

..\ - go back in the current directory - the \ will allow you to continue to "go back" in the directory so that you can implement it in one command.

touch - create new files

mkdir - make directory

less - page through a file

rmdir - remove directory

rm - remove, delete files or directories

help - read a manual page


### 1.4 FOrking and Cloning Reflection

To create a new repository, click the plus sign at the top right hand corner of the page, then click new repository. It will bring you to a new page. In the Repository name box write in the name you want for your new repository. Choose whether your name you want it to be public or private. Then add a .gitignore or a license if you would like. and finally hit "Create Repository"



To fork a repository first click on the file/repository you would like to fork. Then look for the fork button on the top right hand side of the page. At this point you will receive a prompt asking where the repository should be forked to, click on your name and then you are done! You will be redirected to the your new copy of the repository. You will know that, that is the case because your username will precede the repository name.

To clone a repository you will first need to obtain the url of the aforementioned repository. To do this go into github and click on the repository that you would like cloned. You will then see the url on the page, just copy the url onto your clipboard.

Then open your terminal and type in git clone URL_THAT_YOU_COPIED

You would fork a repo for two reasons, the first is so that you can propose changes to someone else' project, by forking the repository, making some modification, then submitting a pull request to the project owner.

The second reason why you would fork a request is to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own.
