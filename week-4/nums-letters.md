<h1> Release 1: Summarize </h1>
<h2> What does puts do? </h2>
<p> Puts is short for "put string," it simply writes onto the screen whatever comes after it. </p>
<h2> What is an integer? What is a float? </h2>
<p> Similarly to what it means in arithmetic, integer referse to numbers without decimal points. Floats, however, are number with decimal points also called "floating-point numbers." </p>
<h2> What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming? </h2>
<p> When Ruby processes integer division, the answer will always be a whole number. For example, if you program "puts 9/2" the program will return "4." Keep in mind that Ruby will always round down. On the other hand When Ruby processes float division, the same program of "puts 9/2" will return "4.5." </p>
<p> In what instant will integer be useful when creating certain programs you ask? Imagine, if you're visiting a local NYC pizza shop and you have Five Dollars. Here a plain slice cost Two Dollars and you only eat plain slices (because thats the true test of great pizza!) And you are creating a program to see how much pizza you can buy, well you wouldnt be able to buy half a slice. So you would have to opt for integer division where you would program "puts 5/2." Enjoy those two slices of pizza! </p>
<h1> Release 2: Try it! </h1>
<p>1. Hours in a year</p>
<p> puts 24 * 365 </p>
<p>2. Minutes in a decade</p>
<p> puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10 </p>

<h1> Release 7: Reflect </h1>
<h2>How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?</h2>
<p> In Ruby addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are executed with + , - , * , /, respectively. </p>
<h2>What is the difference between integers and floats?</h2>
<p> Similarly to integers in arithmetic, integers in Ruby are whole numbers. Floats however, are numbers that contain decimal points. </p>
<h2>What is the difference between integer and float division?</h2>
<p>When Ruby processes integer division, the answer will always be a whole number. For example, if you program "puts 9/2" the program will return "4." Keep in mind that Ruby will always round down. On the other hand When Ruby processes float division, the same program of "puts 9/2" will return "4.5."</p>
<h2>What are strings? Why and when would you use them?</h2>
<p> In Ruby, strings refer to groups of letters in a program. A programmer would use strings because it allows for punctuation, digits, symbols, and spaces in addition to the inclusion of letters. As a matter of fact strings is also capable of arithmetic! </p>
<h2>What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?</h2>
<p> Variables become extremely useful when programming in multiples. When a programmer wants things printed out multiple times they would have to write the program as much times as they want repeated. However, if you set the print to a variable one would only need to "puts" the variable to get the same output. </p>
<h2>How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?</h2>
<p> This challenge was refreshing, its been a while since i went over Ruby on Code Academy so it was nice to have some review. </p>
