##Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a new repository just follows these simple steps.

1. Open and log in to the page GitHub.com
2. Click on the plus sign at the top right hand corner of the page
3. Cick on "new repository" it will now bring up a new page
4. In the Repository name box write the desired name for your new repository
5. Choose whether you want it to be public or private.
6. Add a ".gitignore" or a license
7. Hit "Create Repository"

To clone a repository to your local drive you will need te url of the desired respository. You can find the URl on the page of the repository. Simply log into your GitHub account, click on the desired repository and the repository's URL will be on that page. Once you have copied the URL go into your terminal. When you are in your terminal type git clone "URL_YOU_JUST_COPIED

###Describe what open source means.

By definition open source means denoting software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. It is also sometimes referred to as Free and Open Source Software or (FOSS)  Open source allows individuals access to the source code of the programming they are using instead of only being able to see and use the output of the program. For example, if you are playing a game and you see that they had some spelling errors within the game, a programmer would not be able to change that. However, if the company made the source code available (open source) then you as a programmer would be able to go in and fix the errors, making your own version of the game.
##What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
To me open source makes me feel two different type of ways. On the one hand open-source establishes this as a community where programs and code will be able to progress with the collective efforts of the people in the community. It will simply allow things to develop faster, better , and more efficiently. This would be so if everyone is on the same page with the same level of mutual respect. The other would be if people take other peoples code, since it is now available to them.
###Assess the importance of using licenses.
License are important for developers to add them into their programs because it allows other users to modify their soure code. Additionaly it protects the original authors of the software/code from liability for any claim, damages, or other liability.
##What concepts were solidified in the challenge? you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
A concept that was solidified through this challenge was pushing my changes on my branch through to GitHub, merging it with the master branch, and then pulling my master branch to my local machine. I understand how this is cycle of how my code will be monitored uploaded and added with my peers. Im glad i got this down.
